# Exploratory Data Analysis for WLD_RTP_details Dataset

## Executive Summary:
Using Python, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the WLD_RTP_details dataset. The goal was to uncover patterns, insights, and relationships within the data. This analysis involved data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and data visualization to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

## Business Problem:
Understanding the distribution and relationships within the dataset is essential for making informed business decisions. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify key metrics, trends, and potential areas of improvement that can drive strategic decisions.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded the dataset using pandas.
   - Checked for missing values and basic data information.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created various visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Generated a correlation heatmap to identify the relationships between numerical variables.

### Skills:
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms, Bar Plots, Heatmaps

## Results & Business Recommendation:
Creating visualizations and analyzing the dataset provides valuable insights into key metrics such as the number of markets modeled, average annualized food inflation by country, and the distribution of currency. These insights can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and improve outcomes.

### Key Findings:
1. **Distribution of Number of Markets Modeled**:
   - Visualized the distribution of the number of markets modeled to understand the spread and frequency.
